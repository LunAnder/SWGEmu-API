Inhabitants: CorSec and the Rebellion
Danger Level: HIGH

Distance to Corellia Space Station: 8765m
Distance to Talus Space Station: 7702m

Controlled fiercely by both the Rebellion and the CorSec, the CorSec Wing proves dangerous for members of the Empire. The Rebellion is found to be unsympathetic to Imperial starships flying in the CorSec Wing Quadrant and will shoot them down on sight. Beware."

Inhabitants: CorSec
Danger Level: Low

Distance to Corellia Space Station: 3874m
Distance to Talus Space Station: 13582m

If a quadrant in Corellia could be called safe, Corellia's Own is the one. Only patrolled by CorSec, the trade routes from the Corellia Station to the Talus Station are patrolled mostly by trading freighters and civilian craft. Still, Imperial presence is frowned upon here and proves to be hostile to starships openly claiming to be of the Empire."

Inhabitants: The Empire
Danger Level: Medium

Distance to Naboo Space Station: 5244m
Distance to Rori Space Station: 13463m

Although mostly deserted, one can find a few Imperial patrols circling about Kylantha's Whim.

The Queen kindly refused his offer of marriage, stating her desire to ""marry"" her people and serve them with all of her time. Crushed, the young man renamed the quadrant to Kylantha's Whim. The quadrant has kept its name ever since."

Inhabitants: Hutts, Valarians, the Empire
Danger Level: HIGH

Distance to Dantooine Space Station: 6788m

The first quadrant of Dantooine, fondly nicknamed ""Dantooine's Wrath"", is a pit-stop between a sarlacc pit and being trampled on by a Gorax. It is highly recommended that one stay away from the first quadrant unless absolutely necessary. Dantooine's Wrath is laden with fierce Hutt gunships and unmerciless Valarian thugs."

Mystery shrouds the third quadrant of Dantooine's System and provides history enthusiasts with little information of the founders of Isryn's Veil. For now, it is safe to travel here. Incidentally, the Empire's eyes may have turned to the Veil as a target of expansion efforts.. Will they succeed?"

Inhabitants: Dark Veil Order
Danger Level: HIGH

Distance to Dathomir Space Station: 8273m

Fortunately, not many venture close to the Heart of Dathomir and its clerical inhabitants, the Dark Veil Order. Serving their Queen with passionate ferocity, the Dark Veil Order encircle the Heart of Dathomir, hoping to ""sacrifice"" victims to the nebula's powerful rage.

Closest hyperspace point to the Talus Space Station, the Talus Secta point is incredibly dangerous.

The ongoing war between the two factions makes traveling to the Talus Secta dangerous for both Rebel and Empire allies alike."
