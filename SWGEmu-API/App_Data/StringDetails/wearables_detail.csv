438,lifeday_orb,"Life Day is a holiday celebrated on Kashyyyk, the Wookiee homeworld, in order to recognize the renewal of life and remember those who have passed on. Because Life Day is important for reconnecting with family and friends, Wookiees will brave arduous treks to be reunited with loved ones on the holiday. Although originally celebrated only on Kashyyyk, and usually at the Tree of Life, the concept of Life Day has slowly spread across the galaxy. The Life Day Orb, a Wookiee artifact, is a traditional symbol carried by Wookiees during the Life Day celebrations. 

""We celebrate a day of peace, a day of harmony. A day of joy we all can share together..."" - Traditional Life Day song lyric (translated from Shyriiwook)
