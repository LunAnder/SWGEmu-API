22,awing_chassis_token,"Alliance RZ-1 A-wing Starfighter 
By far the fastest starfighter used in the Galactic Civil War, the compact A-wing is the Rebel Alliance's response to the Empire's growing number of TIE fighters and TIE variants. Because of its speed, the A-wing excels at hit-and-run missions, long-range patrols and reconnaissance, and surgical strikes against large starships. A stock A-wing's speed is provided by two powerful Novaldex J-77 ""Event Horizon"" engines. A combination of adjustable thrust-vector controls built into each engine and thruster-control jets located between the engines supply the vehicle's famed maneuverability. Unfortunately, the A-wing's controls are notoriously sensitive and few pilots can handle the craft at top speed. The A-wing relies on its speed and agility in combat. Its armament is relatively weak, consisting of two wing-mounted blaster cannons. A-wings require constant maintenance, and the Alliance has found it extremely difficult to keep a squadron of A-wings operational for any length of time. Despite this, the A-wing is quickly becoming one of the galaxy's most prominent interceptor fighters.

Being a relatively sluggish ship hasn't made the ""Rihkxyrk"" a push-over. Quite the contrary. The defenses and weapon load of most ""Rihkxyrk"" assault fighters is frightening, and is their hallmark. It can be very demoralizing to line up an ""Rihkxyrk"" in your sights and salvo off missiles and cannon pulses only to see them sloughed off by heavy-duty shielding systems and thick, heavy armor. Most ""Rihkxyrk"" pilots are an unflappable group, developing a high level of confidence in themselves and their machines after wading through heavy fire and coming through undamaged."

The ""Kihraxz"" Assault Fighter is able to quickly close with and surgically attack its target before they are aware.

This might be seen as a dire limitation, but the maneuverability of the ship is such that it can normally avoid attacks that would not be able to withstand. Although a cheaper ship, a number of pilots continue to fly the ""Kihraxz"" even though they could afford something larger, simply because the ship's performance suits their personal combat style."

The VT49 Decimator is most correctly classified as an Assault ship. It is heavily armed and armored, and built to carry light to medium loads into dangerous places. Its form follows its function, and its shape offers a relatively small target with no large fins or wings as seen in some of the less combat-oriented craft of the Empire, such as the Lambda-class shuttle. Armor and deflector shielding is particularly heavy, and the weapons load-out is fearsome and includes turrets capable of engaging any target fast enough to out-maneuver the VT49.

The Firespray-class patrol and attack ship has been recently re-introduced to the market by Kuat Systems Engineering. Although the original design was generated a number of years earlier, the prototype vessels built at that time were all lost in the hangar where they were being stored during an unfortunate prison escape incident. A sole ship survived the catastrophe and the design has since attained some notoriety owing to the escapades of its pilot. Rather than building to contract, KSE had generated the Firespray design as a project to shop around and had fronted all the cash for the prototypes, confident that once people had seen their performance purchase orders would come rolling in. Instead, the loss of the prototypes put the company in financial dire straights with nothing concrete to show for the Firespray project, and no way to generate interest in the product through demonstrations. Having already drained accounts originally stocked by a huge initial financial outlay, KSE mothballed the project and everything that had been built so far, including reams of technical data and all of the specialized tools used to build the prototype vessels. KSE then went on to enhance their existing offerings and go on to carve an even larger niche for themselves in the market for post-sale ship upgrade kits."

Even in the face of tremendous personal risk, the executives of MandalorMotors have opted to provide custom products to both the Empire and the Rebel Alliance, while supporting a gray-market of parts and accessories to private space pilots and the discerning smuggler. The M3-A ""Scyk"" is a very accurate, nimble fighter that functions especially well for base defense and capital ship escort duties.

The Hutt crime faction's space piracy operations have met with a considerable amount of success of late. This is due in no small part to the Empire splitting its attention between piracy suppression and the growing Alliance threat. Sensing an opportunity and spurred on by his pirate fleet's recent accomplishments, Jabba has seen fit to commit more of his resources to the development of larger and more powerful craft. Thus, Jabba commissioned the development of the M22-T Krayt, a turreted heavy fighter designed with the goal of creating a more powerful craft that will hopefully allow fewer pilots to do the work of many. The way Jabba sees it, if he has fewer people flying for him, he doesn't have to split the proceeds from his piracy operation with as many people.
	The M22-T Krayt is built in the same format seen in most in heavy star fighters, with flight crew being limited to workstations accessed from outside the craft. All other interior space is service-access only and can not be accessed during flight. Increases in chassis space have all been allocated to combat equipment such as the turret and its support systems. Regardless of whether the new design serves Jabba's needs, most independent operators are considering the possibility of operating a 2-person ship, something that prior to the M22-T had only been the purview of the military.

From the beginning of the Galactic Civil War, the Emperor has stressed that the conflict will be a war of attrition. Nowhere is that philosophy more evident than in the design and tactics of the staple starfighter of the Imperial Navy, the TIE fighter. TIE fighters are meant to overwhelm enemy forces in huge numbers and have therefore been designed for speed and affordability rather than resilience. The TIE fighter is built around twin ion engine technology and is among the fastest and most maneuverable craft in the galaxy. The TIE fighter can outrun most Alliance vehicles. And while the TIE fighter's standard laser cannons are not very powerful on their own, when dozens of TIE fighters attack simultaneously, they can demolish anything in their path.

The TIE/ln is the direct result of the continual evolution of the TIE fighter design. Revisions in the design brought on by analysis of engagements in which the TIE fighter participated have directed the implementation of little changes to the design which have reached their current level of development in the TIE/ln. This improved TIE can carry a slightly heavier load of weaponry and avionics. The only externally visible difference between the TIE/ln and the TIE is that the newer revision is a slightly darker color.

And while the TIE fighter's standard laser cannons are not very powerful on their own, when dozens of TIE fighters attack simultaneously, they can demolish anything in their path.

The TIE Light Duty is a slighty less powerful version of the TIE fighter. It is used to allow new pilots to get used to the unique nature of flight combat operations in space, without using up more expensive higher-end vessels. TIE Light Duty's are either high-mileage units that are pulled off the line and rebuilt, or are new hulls fitted out with salvaged and refurbished parts. In addition to using lesser-rated parts in the construction of the TIE Light Duty, limiters are placed on the power generation and other systems in an effort to both keep the trainee pilot out of trouble, and prevent over-stressing the weaker equipment.

222,tieadvanced_chassis_token,"Sienar Fleet Systems TIE Advanced x1 Prototype 
The TIE Advanced is the prototype TIE fighter flown by Darth Vader at the Battle of Yavin. An experimental craft combining TIE fighter technology with more conventional starfighter components, like a hyperdrive and deflector shield generators, the TIE Advanced eventually became the template for the incredibly efficient TIE interceptor. As in all TIE starfighters, the prototype's propulsion system revolves around twin ion engines, although its solar ionization reactor is much more powerful than those on standard TIE fighters. Despite the improved power supply, Vader's TIE proved only slightly faster than the previous TIE models due to inefficient shield generators, which consumed a great deal of power, and the increased mass created by the addition of heavy armor plating. With Darth Vader at the controls, the TIE Advanced is a devastating starfighter. While piloting the prototype, Vader very nearly thwarted the Rebel Alliance's attempt to destroy the Death Star. Only the last-minute arrival of Han Solo and the Millennium Falcon prevented the Sith Lord from firing on Luke Skywalker's X-wing. After being clipped by the Falcon's quad laser cannons, the prototype spun into space. Vader eventually regained of control of the craft and fled to the nearest Imperial facility. The prototype has been repaired and remains one of Vader's most prized possessions. "
223,tieaggressor_chassis_token,"SANTHE/SIENAR Technologies TIE Aggressor
The TIE Aggressor is a heavy fighter-bomber multi-role craft that was developed prior to the destruction of the first Death Star and as a direct response to a perceived growth in the amount of heavy shipping aligned with the Rebel Alliance. Its most obvious design feature is an anti-fighter defensive turret mounted on the aft dorsal surface of the fuselage, and a heavier than normal forward-firing laser cannon battery. 
The TIE Aggressor is neither fighter nor bomber, but rather something in between. It's a favorite with the more free-spirited pilots of the Imperial fighter cadre who enjoy longer missions away from base where they can be apart from the larger formations normally associated with an Imperial raid on Rebellion re-supply shipping.

The TIE Aggressor can accomodate a second person in the gunner position.  You must launch while grouped with a friend to take advantage of this feature."
224,tiebomber_chassis_token,"Sienar Fleet Systems TIE Bomber 
Of all the TIE fighter variants produced by Sienar Fleet Systems for the Galactic Empire, the TIE bomber is one of the most effective. The heavy assault ship, designed for strategic strikes against surface and deep space targets, is one of the most heavily-armed starships in the Imperial fleet. TIE bombers utilize the distinctive bent wings found on the TIE Advanced prototype. These solar array panels frame a rounded TIE cockpit and a large ordnance pod that can be configured to carry a wide array of destructive weapons. While not nearly as fast or agile as the original TIE fighter, TIE bombers are much more destructive. A single TIE bomber's payload can include a volatile combination of torpedoes, missiles, and other explosives. TIE bombers are deployed against space stations, orbital docking platforms, and orbital facilities, but they are especially effective against capital ships. After standard TIE fighters weaken the target's defenses, the bombers swoop in to disable vital areas such as the shield generators and engines."

The TIE interceptor is a direct response to the Rebel Alliance's development of faster and more dangerous starfighters. Hoping to develop a vehicle that could compete with the A-wing in both speed and maneuverability, Sienar Fleet Systems has invested huge sums into improving upon the standard TIE fighter's existing twin ion engines. The resulting ion stream projectors allow TIE interceptors to execute tight turns and rolls not possible in most other starfighters. This complex engine system makes the TIE interceptor one of the fastest starfighter in the Imperial fleet, and it outperforms nearly every starfighter in the galaxy during dogfights. The TIE interceptor's bent wings, an element lifted directly from the TIE Advanced prototype, give the starfighter a smaller profile and increased power."
227,tieoppressor_chassis_token,"Sienar Fleet Systems TIE Oppressor Strike Starfighter
A recent development, the TIE Oppressor is being deployed in limited numbers among selected units of the Imperial starfighter cadre elite. It is an attempt to build a variant of the standard TIE hull that can carry heavy weapon payloads with sufficient armor and shielding to allow the ship to operate in the vanguard of an Imperial assault force. It also has enough solar array surface to assist in generation of the energy needed to power it all. All of the offensive and defensive equipment packed into the Oppressor comes at the cost of space for engine installations. Although most Imperial fighters are designed to have superior maneuverability, this is a trait in which the TIE Oppressor is rated by most of its pilots as merely average. This lack of dizzying maneuverability is a result of the Oppressor mounting the same basic engine arrangement as seen on earlier TIE starfighter types, but with its thrust being sapped by much heavier and more solid spaceframe. In return for the deficits in combat maneuvering capability, the Oppressor carries one of the most potent offensive and defensive packages fielded in any Imperial starfighter spaceframe. 

Only the most veteran Imperial TIE pilots are being allowed to participate in the Oppressor flight test program as only these personnel are deemed to have the tactical know-how to properly employ the ship as well as the loyalty to be trusted with such as expensive flight article. Although currently serving in the fleet as part of a 'Limited Fielding Test Initiative' and considered a minor trial program by the Imperial Navy, the actual numbers of fighters being fielded would make most Alliance officers wince.

291,wpn_seismic_missile,"A pack of seismic armor piercing missiles. Seismic missiles, also called ""shakers"", are designed to penetrate the upper layers of a target's armor plating. The missile then shatters into a high frequency pulse-blast that buckles the remaining armor. These missiles are highly effective against armor, but have a hard time penetrating energy shields."

294,wpn_spacebomb_missile_mk1,"A pack of high-yield spacebombs. These missiles are bulky and ponderous. They move toward a target slowly and can only track for a limited amount of time. Due to its slow rate of speed, spacebombs are particularly vulnerable to countermeasure and point defense systems. If the spacebomb survives to reach the target, it packs a wicked punch. Spacebombs are usually deployed against capital ships, undefended hard targets, and targets that aren't carrying countermeasures."

298,xwing_chassis_token,"X-Wing 
Incom Corporation T-65 X-Wing Space Superiority Fighter 
The X-wing is among the most advanced single-pilot starfighter ever produced. The starfighter receives its name from its double-layered wings, which separate into an ""X"" formation during combat to increase the craft's field of fire. Each wing is armed with a high-powered laser cannon and accurate proton torpedo launchers. Although the X-wing is designed for just one pilot and no passengers, the X-wing jockey is never truly alone thanks to the astromech socket located behind the cockpit. One of the X-wing's greatest assets is its durability: the fighter's reinforced titanium alloy hull, deflector shield projectors, and transparisteel canopy ensure that it can withstand several hits without suffering serious damage. The X-wing's history is nearly as important as its capabilities. Designed by Incom Corporation in the early days of the Empire, the X-wing schematics found their way into Rebel hands when several Incom engineers defected to the Alliance. The Rebels began producing the X-wings in modest numbers and the vehicle has quickly become one the most important weapons in the Alliance arsenal."

303,ykl37r_chassis_token,"Gallofree YKL-37R Nova Courier
The Nova Courier follows the pattern well-established by Corellian Engineering Corporation's 'YT' series of transports. Although the larger freighters such as the Medium Transport are built to ply the shipping lanes which are patrolled and relatively free of obstructions, and make their profits on the idea of efficiency of scale, the smaller transports profit off of the special services they offer. They are smaller, more maneuverable vessels equipped for carrying smaller cargos through safe and hazardous space, and they possess a nominal ability to defend themselves. Intended to be crewed by just a handful, almost all systems are made to be accessible and maintainable by a small crew with light tools. In the hands of Rebellion pilots, the Nova Couriers have developed a reputation for being adept at ducking into asteroid belts to avoid pursuers, fighting off individual TIE patrol ships, and generally becoming masters of smuggling weapons, information, and personnel past Imperial blockades."
304,yt1300_chassis_token,"YT-1300 
Corellian Engineering Corporation YT-1300 Transport 
A stock light freighter, the YT-1300 is an adaptable, all-purpose, cargo transport built on a modular design. Off the assembly line, a YT-1300 is a fairly standard vessel, with rudimentary engine, communications, and life-support systems. However, the vessel's appeal is the fact that it can be upgraded with great ease. In fact, Corellian Engineering Corporation has earned a small fortune selling conversion kits. The most popular modification is an enhanced hyperdrive package, although many pilots also outfit the craft with military-grade weapons, long-range sensor suites, and powerful deflector shields. Han Solo's Millennium Falcon is the most infamous (and most heavily-modified) YT-1300 in existence.

305,ywing_chassis_token,"Koensayr BTL-S3 Y-Wing Attack Starfighter 
Prior to the advent of the X-wing, the Y-wing served as the Rebel Alliance's primary attack starfighter. The snub fighter, characterized by its triangular cockpit and two long engine pylons was considered outdated by the time of the Battle of Yavin, but its durability and heavy-firepower has ensured it a place in Alliance fleet. While the Alliance relies on the Y-wing for everything from escort duty to reconnaissance, the starfighter was originally designed for close-quarters combat with space stations and large starships. Light bombing runs and surgical strikes are also part of the Y-wing's mission profile. The starfighter's modular weapons emplacements allow it to be upgraded easily, yet another reason for its continued success. While the Rebel Alliance maintains the largest fleet of active Y-wings, the starfighters are also in heavy use by criminal organizations, mercenary groups, pirates, and privateers.

The Y-Wing can accomodate a second person in the gunner position.  You must launch while grouped with a friend to take advantage of this feature."

One of the oldest starfighters still in use, the Headhunter predates the Battle of Yavin by several decades and has experienced several revivals since its first appearance. The starfighter's longevity is based on its legendary resilience and it still remains an attractive option to mercenaries and security personnel throughout the galaxy. The starfighter is identified by a pair of fixed wings equipped equipped with rear-mounted maneuvering jets. Easy to modify, the Headhunter can support a wide range of laser cannons and missile-launcher, placing it on par with the Y-wing in terms of sheer destructive capability. The Rebel Alliance has even been known to convert Headhunters for short-range bombing runs. The Rebels also use Headhunters for training missions because the vehicle's controls are nearly identical to those of the X-wing and Y-wing. "
