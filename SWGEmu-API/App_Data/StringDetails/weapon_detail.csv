56,lance_lightsaber_gen1,"This lightsaber will not power on without one color crystal inside.  This version of saber may hold two crystals.

A Modified Jedi weapon which has a second emitter matrix on the opposite end of the handgrip creating a double-blade. It consists of a cylindrical handle in which sophisticated circuits channel a beam of light through a series of crystals.  These crystals modulate the blade's size and amplitude. When activated, internal power cells create photoelectric energy which is focused through the series of crystals.  The energy is formed into a tight, parallel beam of coherent packets. These packets are emitted through a positively-charged continuous energy lens which projects the packets away from the lightsaber. The packets are almost immediately attracted back to the lightsaber by a negatively-charged high-energy flux aperture, and then continually recycled to create the glowing blade. The packets are recycled by a superconductor back into the power cell for re-energizing. The entire process is completely contained. No heat is generated and no energy is lost, since the light in the blade is recaptured. The only energy loss occurs when the blade strikes an object causing crystal decay.

The energy is formed into a tight, parallel beam of coherent packets. These packets are emitted through a positively-charged continuous energy lens which projects the packets away from the lightsaber. The packets are almost immediately attracted back to the lightsaber by a negatively-charged high-energy flux aperture, and then continually recycled to create the glowing blade. The packets are recycled by a superconductor back into the power cell for re-energizing. The entire process is completely contained. No heat is generated and no energy is lost, since the light in the blade is recaptured.  The only energy loss occurs when the blade strikes an object causing crystal decay.

156,sword_lightsaber_gen5,"This lightsaber will not power on without one color crystal inside.  This version of saber may hold five crystals.

A Traditional Jedi weapon, it consists of a cylindrical handle in which sophisticated circuits channel a beam of light through a series of crystals.  These crystals modulate the blade's size and amplitude. When activated, internal power cells create photoelectric energy which is focused through the crystals.
