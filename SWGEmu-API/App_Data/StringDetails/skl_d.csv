197,combat_smuggler,"A Smuggler is a rogue like character who profits from shady deals behind the backs of the authorities.  Transporting everything from illegal weapons to refugees through Imperial blockades, the Smuggler becomes a master of subterfuge and manipulation.  A Novice Smuggler gains the ability to slice simple locking devices (such as containers) and the ability to acquire several questionable spices."
198,combat_smuggler_armor_03,Modifying most open market armor systems isn't as easy as bolting on extra metal plates.  Modern armor technology is carefully designed and balanced...managed by precision stabilizer CPU logic.  Armor manufacturers often protect their secrets by installing self-destructing anti-tamper chips into the armor logic systems.  A Smuggler with the right know-how can bypass these defenses and integrate complex armor improvements into the stabilizer systems.
199,combat_smuggler_combat_01,"There may not be much honor in it, but sometimes the best way to stay alive is to play dead.  More than one Smuggler has made a successful run because they acted like their ship was scrap or a grazing shot was fatal.  The oldest trick in the book."
200,combat_smuggler_combat_02,It isn't fun to get shot at and Smugglers know this more than anyone.  You don't have to hit your target to make them duck long enough for you to get away.  The /panicshot command lets you delay your enemies next action while you plan yours.
201,combat_smuggler_combat_03,"When you're in a life or death situation, honor has to take a back seat to survival.  Shooting for the knees or the groin might not be honorable, but it'll give you the chance to get out of harm's way.  Using the /lowblow command, you can knock your opponent down for a little while."
202,combat_smuggler_combat_04,"Nothing is more dangerous than a cornered smuggler with a trusted blaster.  A Smuggler is a gambler at heart and would rather take a chance with a wild attack than lie down and die.  The /lastditch command will let you take several well-aimed and powerful shots, but will leave you open for a counterattack.  Make sure those shots count."
203,combat_smuggler_master,"The Master Smuggler has contacts all throughout the galaxy.  They are known by reputation to be a gambler, but always work with a certain charm.  At this skill level, the Smuggler can purchase faction perks at a 25% price reduction."
204,combat_smuggler_novice,"A Smuggler is a rogue like character who profits from shady deals behind the backs of the authorities.

A Novice Smuggler gains the ability to slice simple locking devices (such as containers) and the ability to acquire several questionable spices."
205,combat_smuggler_slicing_01,Slicing is the practice of using technology to defeat technology: hacking and cracking.  A Smuggler will never know when they might need to override a security system or slip past a defense mechanism.  A Smuggler with the ability to slice public mission terminals can earn a few extra credits by carefully tricking the terminal systems into rewarding him a higher than normal cut.  Other terminals may be sliceable as well.
206,combat_smuggler_slicing_02,Basic weapon slicing gives the Smuggler the ability to jury-rig a weapon with his slicing knowledge.  The modified weapon might have a faster refire rate or improved damage output.  Weapons sliced in this manner often do not last as long as their stock counterparts.
207,combat_smuggler_slicing_03,"Armor slicing gives the Smuggler the ability to make careful improvements to a piece of armor's statistics.  The armor may be lightened, reducing its encumbrance penalty, or the damage absorbance may be improved."
208,combat_smuggler_slicing_04,Advanced Weapon Slicing doubles the quality of improvements the Smuggler can make to a weapon.
209,combat_smuggler_spice_01,"Spices are controlled substances that alter the body's chemistry.  Some are used for recreational purposes, others can be used to enhance physical strength.  Coming off of the effects of spice can be rough on the body.  While not illegal, the Empire tightly controls the sale of spice.  Smugglers are often hired by third parties to move large shipments of spice through Imperial blockades."
210,combat_smuggler_spice_02,Some medical and industrial chemicals can be used as physical enhancements...occasionally with dangerous side effects.  These materials are closely controlled by the Empire.  Smugglers have found it profitable to help make these chemicals more widely available.
211,combat_smuggler_spice_03,Some medical and industrial chemicals can be used as physical enhancements...occasionally with dangerous side effects.  These materials are closely controlled by the Empire.  Smugglers have found it profitable to help make these chemicals more widely available.
212,combat_smuggler_spice_04,Some forms of spice have radical and powerful effects on humanoid physiology.  These tightly controlled substances are often experimental forms of military or medical research.  Smugglers able to get their hands on shipments of high quality 'Chems' can find buyers among the rich and powerful.
213,combat_smuggler_underworld_01,"A Smuggler deals with aliens every day, negotiating the finer points of a contract legal and otherwise.  This requires both good negotiation skills and the ability to understand the languages of the parties involved.  This skill grants the ability to understand most languages spoken in the galaxy.  It also reduces the cost of all faction perks by 10% for the smuggler."
214,combat_smuggler_underworld_02,"When things get desperate the best way to get out of trouble isn't with a gun: it's with fast talking.  With this skill, a Smuggler loses only half the normal faction penalty for dying in PvP combat.  (The smuggler saves face by convincing his friends it was all a misunderstanding.)  The Smuggler is also only worth half the normal faction award."
215,combat_smuggler_underworld_03,"A Smuggler is motivated by two things: survival and profit.  Sometimes it's necessary to change sides in a conflict to achieve those goals.  With the ""Selling Out"" skill, a Smuggler can trade faction points for cash at any opposing faction recruiter."
216,combat_smuggler_underworld_04,A Smuggler's work puts him in contact with a lot of people in high places.  A Smuggler can draw upon these connections to improve his standing with various organizations....at a price.
217,combat_smuggler_weapons_04,"A Smuggler needs every edge they can get: in negotiation and in battle.  A choice weapon modifiation can lend the extra punch needed to convince an adversary that your price is acceptable.  At the Slicing IV skill level, the smuggler can jury rig a weapon to suit their personal tactical needs."
