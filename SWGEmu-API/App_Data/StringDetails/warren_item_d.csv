Purpose: Remove creature brains, modify with cyborg technology, and replace.

Approval Code: NOT APPROVED

Project Status: Complete

Notes: 
The experiment is complete, and was a moderate success. The brains of the animals that were collected from several different planets were removed and infused with cyborg technology developed here in the compound. Replacing the brains within the creatures was somewhat more difficult than expected, but recovery time fell within the established parameters. Device control is operating at 94% effectiveness, although an increased display of aggression has been observed.

Experiment # 1173

Purpose: Remove creature brains, modify for implantation into a droid.

Approval Code: NOT APPROVED

Project Status: Complete

Notes: 
Creature brains have been removed and modified with cybernetic implants that allow transmission of electro-kinetic activity directy to a series of servo-motors (such as the type that are found in many types of droids). The results of this experiment fall along the projected outcomes; a decrease in the drain from the power supply, and a slight increase in subject response time. It should be noted that the organic brain cannot entirely replace only a portion of the central computer of the droid. A minor amount of damage control and visual feedback is left to the core processing unit. The success rate of this procedure is approximately one out of three.

Results indicate that further experiments using larger droids or possibly vehicles may be

MEMORANDUM

From: Colonel Bors Teraud

Re: Experimentation on sentient species

Our recent experiments in the creature laboratories have shown excellent promise, and I believe that we can move forward to the next phase of our research. The studies that have been conducted show that the Device that is currently used to harness the cyborg creatures can be modified to also control cyborgs created from sentient beings.

Doctor Knag wish to begin experiments along these lines as quickly as possible, but we will need test subjects. I will inquire amongst my loyal officers to see if there are any volunteers, but until then we may wish to ""acquire"" some subjects from the Worker's Quarters on the first floor. I doubt anyone will miss them.

Keep me posted on any developments.

Experiment # 1230

Purpose: Test cyborg stability and stamina. Determine project feasibility.

Approval Code: NOT APPROVED

Project Status: Complete

Notes: 
Twenty unique sentient cyborg types were tested in physical capability and combat aptitude and compared to the Imperial standard for the Stormtrooper. The cyborgs uniformly displayed skills that were slightly less than average to that of the common Stormtrooper. The complete results can be found in the main compound computer.

However, the cost of creating and maintaining a cyborg is far less expensive than the training and salary for a Stormtrooper. It is deemed that the monetary gain outweighs the decrease in combat ability. Additionally, it is possible that new cyborgs can be created from fresh corpses, yielding a potentially endless supply of soldiers.

Recommend that the project move

Entry 1784:

The construction of my cyborg army continues, I was beginning to run out of ""volunteers"". I must remember to thank the Emperor for sending me so many soldiers that are willing to be killed by my men, only to be revived into my cyborg army!

Before long, even the Emperor will recognize the might of my army and bow before me. All will see that the ability of the Force is insignificant next to the power of a centralized brain that can control armies of creatures and droids. And I will be immortal with a mechanical body that never dies...

Experiment # 1433

Purpose: Vehicular cyborg initial experiments

Approval Code: NOT APPROVED

Project Status: Complete

Notes: 
First experiments regarding the implatation of an organic brain into a moderately large vehicle were successful, but the results were not as was hoped. The massive creature's brain that was used was resistant to cyborg technology, and even after sufficient modification, it was reluctant to accept commands from the Control Device. However, when it was under our control the brain did seem capable of maneuvering the All-Terrain Scout Transport sufficiently.

The product of this experiment is deemed NOT SUITABLE for combat purposes, but further study into this branch of the project is recommended."
