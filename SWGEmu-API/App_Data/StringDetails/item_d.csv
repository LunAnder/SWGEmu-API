... My troops carried out my plans earlier this evening regarding a particular Edwind Vintue. Constantly, he has tried to ruin my campaign by spreading falsified rumors and damaging stories. I am thankful that such things will no longer be heard by the common folk of Bestine. There is no need to fill their mind with things of which they do not know... and should not know. Let this be a lesson to those who try to oppose me. I will win this election even if it is the last thing I do. Edwind Vintue is no more and those who follow his steps will find themselves in the same fate as their predecessor ...

265,victor_questp_testimony,"A testimony which reads as follows:

Victor Visalis came to my aid when I needed help most. After a particularly brutal attack from the Sand People, I lost he who meant more to me than anything in this life; my son. The Sand People stole him away from me. I couldn't save him. I have never been taught in the arts of the pistol or that of brawling. Somehow, Victor Visalis heard of my plight and ordered his own personal band of troopers to save my son from the clutches of evil. I write this testimony in hopes that it will be good enough to be presented as sufficient evidence in the upcoming election. Not only did Victor Visalis save my son, but he was also kind enough to supply us with enough money so that we may receive proper education. I'm currently studying to become a politician. Just like Victor Visalis.
